# Nvim Configs

This repo records my configurations of nvim and neovide.

It's not written from scratch on my own. I created it by learning this blogs: [从零开始配置 Neovim(Nvim)](https://martinlwx.github.io/zh-cn/config-neovim-from-scratch/#%E4%BB%8E%E9%9B%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE-nvim)
And take the author's configuration, [MartinLwx/dotfiles](https://github.com/MartinLwx/dotfiles/), as reference and add the plugins that I needed for now.

So if you are interested in it, thank you and take it by yourself. 😉
